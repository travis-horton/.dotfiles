# .dotfiles

starting out on my dotfiles journey

in case of emergency:
install apple command line dev tools ```xcode-select --install```
install home-brew

how to use this
[TODO: needs update post zsh]
clone https://github.com/kiddspazz/dotfiles into $HOME
run setup.s

right now this only works for macOS terminal configs -- need to update for
linux distros as well
