# .dotfiles

Starting out on my dotfiles journey

### In case of emergency:
Install apple command line dev tools
```
xcode-select --install
```

Install home-brew:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL \ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### How to use this:
In the `$HOME` dir:
```
git clone `https://github.com/kiddspazz/dotfiles
```
Other steps...tbd

### TODO: Other stuff to get truly set update, probably including:
Get vim plugins
Write a little script to create symlinks for things in .bin and .zsh configs
